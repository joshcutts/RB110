Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients. 
Unfortunately he is not good in maths. Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) 
and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). For simplicity there are no units for the amounts 
(e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

EXAMPLES:
p cakes({"flour"=>500, "sugar"=>200, "eggs"=>1},{"flour"=>1200, "sugar"=>1200, "eggs"=>5, "milk"=>200}) == 2
p cakes({"cream"=>200, "flour"=>300, "sugar"=>150, "milk"=>100, "oil"=>100},{"sugar"=>1700, "flour"=>20000, "milk"=>20000, "oil"=>30000, "cream"=>5000}) == 11
p cakes({"apples"=>3, "flour"=>300, "sugar"=>150, "milk"=>100, "oil"=>100},{"sugar"=>500, "flour"=>2000, "milk"=>2000}) == 0
p cakes({"apples"=>3, "flour"=>300, "sugar"=>150, "milk"=>100, "oil"=>100},{"sugar"=>500, "flour"=>2000, "milk"=>2000, "apples"=>15, "oil"=>20}) == 0
p cakes({"eggs"=>4, "flour"=>400},{}) == 0
p cakes({"cream"=>1, "flour"=>3, "sugar"=>1, "milk"=>1, "oil"=>1, "eggs"=>1},{"sugar"=>1, "eggs"=>1, "flour"=>3, "cream"=>1, "oil"=>1, "milk"=>1}) == 1

PROBLEM:
input: 2 hashes
output: integer, representing the smallest # of times we can make the given recipe (hash 1)

EXAMPLES:
p cakes({"flour"=>500, "sugar"=>200, "eggs"=>1},{"flour"=>1200, "sugar"=>1200, "eggs"=>5, "milk"=>200}) == 2
p cakes({"cream"=>200, "flour"=>300, "sugar"=>150, "milk"=>100, "oil"=>100},{"sugar"=>1700, "flour"=>20000, "milk"=>20000, "oil"=>30000, "cream"=>5000}) == 11
p cakes({"apples"=>3, "flour"=>300, "sugar"=>150, "milk"=>100, "oil"=>100},{"sugar"=>500, "flour"=>2000, "milk"=>2000}) == 0
p cakes({"apples"=>3, "flour"=>300, "sugar"=>150, "milk"=>100, "oil"=>100},{"sugar"=>500, "flour"=>2000, "milk"=>2000, "apples"=>15, "oil"=>20}) == 0
p cakes({"eggs"=>4, "flour"=>400},{}) == 0
p cakes({"cream"=>1, "flour"=>3, "sugar"=>1, "milk"=>1, "oil"=>1, "eggs"=>1},{"sugar"=>1, "eggs"=>1, "flour"=>3, "cream"=>1, "oil"=>1, "milk"=>1}) == 1

DATA STRUCTURE:

ALGORITHM:
- create empty array to hold max # of cakes creatable by each ingredient alone
- iterate through the directions hash
  - use the key of the directions hash to find value of ingredient
  - return 0 if the value is nil (missing ingredient)
  - divide the value of ingredient by the amount required in the direction && push to array
- find the minimum from the array holding # of cakes creatable by each ingredient alone

=end

def cakes(directions, pantry_ingredients)
  creatable_cakes = []
  directions.each do |direction_ingredient, direction_amount|
    pantry_ingredient_amount = pantry_ingredients[direction_ingredient]
    return 0 if pantry_ingredient_amount == nil
    possible_cakes_per_ingredient = pantry_ingredient_amount / direction_amount
    creatable_cakes << possible_cakes_per_ingredient
  end
  creatable_cakes.min
