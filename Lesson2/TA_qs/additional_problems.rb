# Find the missing letter
# Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.
#
# You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.
#
# The array will always contain letters in only one case.

# Example:
#
# ['a','b','c','d','f'] -> 'e'
# ['O','Q','R','S'] -> 'P'

# Use the English alphabet with 26 letters.

p find_missing_letter(["a","b","c","d","f"]) == "e"
p find_missing_letter(["O","Q","R","S"]) == "P"
p find_missing_letter(["b","d"]) == "c"
p find_missing_letter(["a","b","d"]) == "c"
p find_missing_letter(["b","d","e"]) == "c"







# For "x", determine how many positive integers less than or equal to "x" are odd but not prime. Assume "x" is an integer between 1 and 10000.

# Example: 5 has three odd numbers (1,3,5) and only the number 1 is not prime, so the answer is 1
# Example: 10 has five odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9) and only 1 and 9 are not prime, so the answer is 2

# A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

p odd_not_prime(15) == 3
p odd_not_prime(48) == 10
p odd_not_prime(82) == 20





# A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.
# A vowel substring is a substring that only consists of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') and has all five vowels present in it.
# Given a string word, return the number of vowel substrings in word.
